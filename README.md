# SServer
Schematics and code for the home server I designed using ESP8266 with 32GB USB storage for hosting Sanctuary and Darwin on local network.

NOTE: The code given here is opensource and basic. Thus meant only for testing your homeserver functionality. 
I have not released/opensourced the entire codebase which I am utilising in my homeserver for now. It is however, 
possible I will do so in future when I move onto more complex system. Hence this codebase does not have a file system
nor any other advanced features.
